# To Do List

## Document environment settings

## Document hydra settings

## Run example of Alex
- check output (tensorboard, hydra)

## Add own example: Solve Ramsey model
- Goal: compare solution DEQN vs. Projection
- Write down model + steady state

## Solve projection, without stochastic shocks
Steps Projection:
- Solve model with Projection
    - initial guess: linear approximation around s.s.
    - approximation: spline
- Simulate model?

## Solve DEQN, without stochastic shocks
Steps DEQN
- Implement model => solve model
- Simulate model?

## Add stochasticity in Projeciton + DEQN
