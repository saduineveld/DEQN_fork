# To Do List

## Test evaluation of policy function
- BM: multiple simulations: save one file per variable (each path is a column or row)
- RBC_noquad: save one file per variable (each path is a colum or row)

## Solve RBC model with DEQN (no quadrature)
- Make new RBC files for to DEQN format

## Add model description of bm1972

##  Write Manual for the DEQN library

## Make new repo: DEQN-SD
- add references/citations (and include papers)


## Add stochasticity in Projeciton + DEQN
